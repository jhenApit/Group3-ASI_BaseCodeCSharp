# HR Automation System

Group 3 Summer Bridge Project

## Overview
The HR Automation System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the entire recruitment process within an organization. This system aims to simplify the hiring process by automating various tasks, from posting job openings to managing applicant data and conducting interviews. The system assumes manual input for some scheduling aspects while automating notifications and reminders to relevant stakeholders. Here is an overview of the key functionalities:

### Job Posting:
- The system allows HR personnel to list job openings with relevant details, such as job description, qualifications, and application deadlines.
- HR can add, edit, and delete job openings as needed.

### Application and Screening:

- `Public Application Form`: Applicants can access a user-friendly application form that includes required fields for applying to available jobs. They can also upload their Resumes.
- `Applicant Database`: The system maintains a self-updating database of all applicants and their application details. It assigns each applicant a unique tracking ID to monitor their progress through the hiring process.
- `Automated Tracker`: The database automatically tracks the status of applications, including stages like rejected, shortlisted, HR interview, technical interview, background check, and more.
- `Applicant Tracker ID Request-and-View`: Applicants can view their tracking status by entering their unique ID without the need to log in.

### Shortlisting Applicants:
- The system identifies and tracks applicants who are shortlisted based on their qualifications and suitability for the job description.

### Automated Notification:
- The system sends automated notifications to HR and applicants whenever an applicant's status changes in the Applicant Database.

### Interviews:
- `HR Scheduler`: HR personnel can manually input interviewer schedules, and the system sends email notifications to the interviewers and applicants.
- `Automated Reminder`: The system sends regular reminders to interviewers and HR to ensure timely scheduling.

### Automated Interview/Exam Scheduling:
- The system assumes manual setting of exam dates and updates the Applicant Database accordingly.

### Background Check:
- `Contact Character References`: The system collects character reference information from applicants and sends emails requesting them to fill out a Character Reference Form.
- `Character Reference Form`: HR can view the results of the character reference forms to check an applicant's background.
- `Automated Reminder`: The system sends reminders to character references who haven't responded within 48 hours.
- `Automated Notification`: HR receives an email notification when a character reference form is successfully submitted.

### Job Offer:
- HR can extend job offers to selected candidates and update the Applicant Database accordingly.
- Approved applicants can be tagged as hired, and rejected applicants can be marked as failed.

### User Management:
- The system allows HR personnel to manage user accounts with the ability to add, edit, and delete user profiles.

Overall, the Automated Recruitment and Applicant Tracking System aims to enhance efficiency and communication throughout the hiring process, reducing manual administrative tasks and providing a seamless experience for both HR personnel and applicants. By automating various stages, the system helps organizations find the right candidates more effectively and ensures a smooth onboarding process for successful applicants.
